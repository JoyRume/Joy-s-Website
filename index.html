              <p>.
                Rottweilers have a strong reputation for protection work and guarding. Their size, loud bark, and
                 protective nature have the potential to make them excellent protectors. Unfortunately, years of poor breeding 
                 has diluted previously strong and highly driven working lines. This has led to temperamentally unsound dogs
                  we would not view as being appropriate for family protection work. However, on occasion, this is not the case, 
                  and we recently sourced a number of Rottweilers that meet our very specific requirements to train as family 
                  protection dogs.
